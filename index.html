         <p style=" color: rgb(223, 144, 26);">
            Graduated with honors from Yıldız Technical University, I am an architect with a passion for 
            integrating design and technology. My architectural education has equipped me with a strong 
            foundation in spatial design, aesthetics, and problem-solving. However, my curiosity has led me 
            to explore the world of programming and web design, bridging the gap between architecture and 
            digital technology. </p>

         <p style=" color: rgb(223, 144, 26);">
            Following my graduation, I proactively formed a team and delved into various urban and architectural 
            design competitions. Our collaborative efforts resulted in notable achievements such as a 3rd 
            Honorable Mention in the Büyükada Phaeton Square Urban Design Competition and a Jury Special Award 
            in the Topkapı Kaleiçi Square Urban Design Competition. </p>
            
         <p style=" color: rgb(223, 144, 26);">
            In 2022, I expanded my academic horizons by enrolling in the Urban Design master's program at 
            Istanbul Technical University. Here, I have been able to merge my architectural background with 
            digital technology, experimenting with computational design tools and exploring the potential of 
            machine learning in urban planning. </p>
            
         <p style=" color: rgb(223, 144, 26);">
            During my master's program, our team was recognized as finalists in the TerraViva "Tactical Urbanism 
            Now! 2023" Competition. We are currently working on transforming our proposed project for 
            earthquake-prone areas in Turkey into a social initiative. </p>
        
         <p style=" color: rgb(223, 144, 26);">
            With a growing interest and proficiency in programming and web design, I am excited to announce my 
            aspiration to continue my career as a front-end developer. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my 
            combined expertise in architecture and digital technology to create intuitive and engaging user 
            experiences. As I continue my studies at Istanbul Technical University, I am committed to honing my 
            front-end development skills and contributing to innovative projects that blend design and technology.
